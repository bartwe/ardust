Multiplayer Dwarf fortress


hectic, lots of players, command and control, god game


Clients submit their desired actions to the server. (for the next tick)
Server does the things, sends out world updates. (no more then 5hz, actions likely take multiple ticks)

Not much ai in the dwarfs. (And that there is, is run in the client)

dwarf tiles are 32x32 probably using somethign like 24x30 of those

world tiles are 32x16 for the top with a 32x32 below it for the side.

World tiles are the same for all sides.

Actions are either location dependent, like ftl,
or a think you ask the dwarf todo at the spot he's standing.

to start with

 - render a bit of world
 - render a dwarf
 - get the server running.
 - submit an action to move a dwarf


optional things not for the starting day

- modular dwarf graphics


would be cool, but maybe not

- directional dwarf graphics
